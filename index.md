# [math23c_bot\(\)](http://kem406.github.io/MATH-E23C/math23c_bot/)

Here is the "documentation" for math23c_bot() and all its sub-functions. math23c_bot() is an R function that can take in a dataset as a parameter and employ several statistical methods (barplots, scatterplots, permutation tests, chi-square tests, etc.) to find relationships within the data. It can also utilize machine learning techniques (decision trees and neural nets) to make predictions.

Using the [forestfires.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the math23c_bot() function was able to find relationships between the time of week/year and the spread rate of forest fires in the Montesinho Natural Park, as well as use information on the temperature, rain, wind speed, and relative humidity to predict where a fire is most likely to occur in a 9x9 grid of the park on any given day.
